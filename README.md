# Gonzales_David_SVGAssignment
 Repository containing the SVG Assignment
 
I have created a simple web page for the 6 SVG's I will potentially be using for my FIP. 
They have a simple CSS animation, and are ready to be tracked using JS.
This is made possible using simple querySelecting, addEventListening, and the use of arrow functions to assign the id into a variable, which can be interacted with..
The console logs when the user is interacting with a certain SVG.
I stylized their CSS so the design fit my preferred aesthetic, and added a personalized description. 
Also included an image.



## From Rubric
Each Student must build a branded, scalable themed icon set using Adobe Illustrator. Export each icon from Illustrator as an SVG. Use
the SVGs as assets on the FIP/Brand Revival site (think icons for different flavours or ingredients). Add some simple interac>vity with
JavaScript. Use HTML (and the appropriate elements) to include a descrip>on of the icon set.

### Assignment Requirements
Use Terminal, Git and Github to create the project structure and a linked repository. Create a minimum of 6 SVG icons in Illustrator. Use
CSS to organize the icons on an HTML page (products)in your FIP. You can choose how you want to implement this - as an image tag
source, as an SVG tag, or using the object tag.

Use CSS interac>ons or transi>ons to change the icon’s appearance (on hover, as an example, reverse all of the colours or add a drop
shadow, etc). When clicked log a message to the console with the ID of the element that you’ve clicked. The ID should be retrieved and
displayed with a JavaScript string template and variable (refer to the class example).

Push the finished files to your repo; include a readme that describes the project. Merge everything to the main branch and submit a
link to the dropbox on FOL - a .txt file is fine.
